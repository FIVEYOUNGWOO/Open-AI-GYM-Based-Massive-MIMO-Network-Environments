# Massive-MIMO-PY

I have implemented a multi-cell massive MIMO downlink scenario with imperfect CSI in Python.

This code offers insights into massive MIMO systems and can contribute to building a deep reinforcement learning environment for various types of massive MIMO networks.

Its validity was confirmed by comparison with the findings in Emil Bjornson's 'Massive MIMO Book':
